# 📝 Sign-up Form Project

A registration interface project developed to strengthen my skills in HTML forms, CSS styling/design, and JavaScript validation logic.

The main focus of this project was to practice UI (User Interface) fundamentals and handle user input effectively, ensuring a clean and functional experience for the end-user.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Semantic structure for the registration form and inputs.
- **CSS3**: Layout design, custom typography (Google Fonts), and visual feedback for input states.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Client-side logic for form validation and data integrity.

## 🛠️ Key Features & Learning Goals
- **Form Handling**: Deep dive into input types, labels, and built-in validation attributes.
- **Password Confirmation**: Implementation of a JS script that verifies if the "Password" and "Confirm Password" fields match, providing visual cues to the user.
- **UI/UX Design**: Focus on desktop layout organization, shadows, and spacing to create a professional look.

> **Note:** This project is **not responsive**. The primary goal was to master form structure and styling for desktop screens as part of a specific technical exercise.

## 📖 Project Context
As a student of **Analysis and Development Systems**, I built this project to bridge the gap between static HTML/CSS and functional JavaScript interactions, improving my ability to handle user data before submission.
